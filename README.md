# FASHIONS-MNIST-DATASET
MNIST Image Dataset has been used to build different types of Neural networks for classification.The following Neural Network architectures have been implemented: <br>
Convolutional Neural Network <br>
Transfer Learning Network <br>

An voting ensemble has been implemented and evaluated over the built models
